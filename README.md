## Why Eclipse

Eclipse was designed to bridge Luna services with Stremio addons in one polished app. The goal is simple: search faster, pick the right result with better metadata, watch with stronger controls, keep progress synced, and continue across anime, movies, shows, manga, and novels.

## Install

AltStore and SideStore users can add this source:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Soupy-dev/Luna/main/altsource.json
```

New to sideloading? This guide is a good starting point:

```text
https://gist.github.com/sinceohsix/688637ac04695d1ff38f844acc8ba7f3
```

SideStore is not required. Other sideloading options work too, and `r/sideloaded` has many community guides.


## Notes

- VLC and MPV are the main Players, use the one you prefer
- VLC uses the Swift Package Manager `VLCKitSPM` build.
- Picture in Picture is not enabled for VLC because of current VLCKit stability limits.
- Use GitHub Issues for feature requests and bug reports.
- The app does use AI for development. As I don't know swift well (learning other languages like Java and soon C, not swift). Just for transparency. The app gets tested a ton, and I do try to make sure the code looks okay



## License

Eclipse is released under the GNU General Public License version 3. See `LICENSE`.

The original Luna project is available at `https://github.com/cranci1/Luna`.

Source code for builds distributed from this repository is available at `https://github.com/Soupy-dev/Luna`. If you redistribute an IPA or another binary, provide the corresponding source under GPLv3.

This program comes with no warranty, to the extent permitted by law.

## Bring Your Own Sources

Eclipse ships as an app shell and media manager. It does not provide hosted media, built-in piracy sources, or bundled addons.

Users are responsible for the services and addons they choose to add. The app and developer do not support piracy.

To add a service/addon, click the top right settings icon in the homescreen and then click services. Then click the top right plus icon and choose whichever type of link you copied.


## Build Configuration

Secrets and API keys are loaded from ignored local configuration files instead of tracked source files.

For iOS, copy `Build.local.xcconfig.example` to `Build.local.xcconfig` and fill in the values you need.

For Android, copy `android/local.properties.example` to `android/local.properties` and fill in the values you need. Gradle also accepts matching environment variables or Gradle properties, and can fall back to matching values in `Build.xcconfig` or `Build.local.xcconfig`.

Configured keys include:

- `TMDB_API_KEY`
- `ANILIST_CLIENT_ID`
- `ANILIST_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `TRAKT_CLIENT_ID`
- `TRAKT_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `MAL_CLIENT_ID`
- `MAL_CLIENT_SECRET`
